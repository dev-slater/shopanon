Scope: What are you planning to build? What do you reasonably think you can implement in the time period?
I would like to build an ecommerce app using the DR stack 
Using a well known websiteâ€™s API (hoping to use Rainforest API) i would like to create a store where you favorite items and see a list of what you would hope to purchase 
Implement Heroku, Django Auth, Api and a pleasing UI in the timeframe 
User Stories: Who is your user? What features will your app have?
Our users are everyday folks who want to shop without their every move tracked by companies looking to sell their data. 
Off the grid shopping wish list that allows for anonymous cataloging without the hassle of browsing on amazon and having ads follow you for years
Think of it as offline-online shopping 
User Flow: What is your user doing on your site? Why are they there? How will they navigate your core features and functionality?
As a user, I can login and visit my profile. Looking past the profile i can begin to search the api for items to add to my virtual cart. I can display items to show me exactly what I will get and save them to my profile for later use
All of this would happen on a free and open source platform, without any ads or follow up emails
This would take the stress and strain out of the shopping experience  
Wireframes: Sketch out what your core pages will look like and how they will work. Consider making a paper prototype to demonstrate and/or test key user interactions.
Wireflow
Data Models: Draw out the models and any associations for your project in an entity relationship diagram (ERD).
In Repository
Milestones: Divide your work into parts - the most essential features for your MVP, features that are important but not essential, and features that can be saved for a later iteration. Create 3-5 major milestones with dates outlining when you expect essential features will be done.
